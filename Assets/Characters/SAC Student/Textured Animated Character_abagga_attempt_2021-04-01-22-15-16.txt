Hi,

My laptop was running around 25 fps when i played the animation so I did 750 frames dancing motion which came out to roughly 31 seconds for me. I also had an issue where the textured paint version only showed when I selected the cube under parented armature and then going into textured paint mode. All aside it was fun doing this project.

Thanks.
